    "content": "Introduction Who Am I? Hello there! I’m Timothy, just like you. I’ve discovered something interesting about myself while working on personal projects like OS installation, Virtual Machines, and running servers. I have this tendency to dive into various tangents, exploring different avenues along the way. It hasn’t always been smooth sailing, as I’ve faced my fair share of obstacles. But you know what? I’ve never let them discourage me. Instead, I’ve embraced the challenge, searching high and low for solutions and workarounds.\nThat’s precisely why I decided to create this website—to capture and share my experiences and implementations of these projects. It’s a digital journal that not only serves as a reference for myself but also aims to help others facing similar hurdles. After all, why keep these solutions to myself when they can bring relief to fellow adventurers?\nSo, let’s embark on this journey together! Here’s a list of the projects I’m eager to tackle:\nOS installation: Unveiling the secrets of operating systems and making installation a breeze. Virtual Machines: A virtual world where we can explore endless possibilities and run multiple systems simultaneously. Running servers: Mastering the art of server management and turning challenges into triumphs. I promise you an inviting and inspiring space where we can learn, solve problems, and perhaps share a chuckle or two along the way. Join me on this adventure, and let’s unlock the potential of these projects together!\nSome topics that interest me as of now :\nWebsites Apps Improvements Social Nextcloud Commercial Cloud Service Nextcloud Fork, purpose built to have office integrations.
